# Employee Retention Analysis

This project aims to explore employee retention by analyzing the factors influencing whether employees leave a company or continue to work. The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression to gain insights and build predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `HR_comma_sep.csv`, containing the following columns:

- `satisfaction_level`: Employee satisfaction level.
- `last_evaluation`: Last performance evaluation score.
- `number_project`: Number of projects handled by the employee.
- `average_montly_hours`: Average monthly hours worked.
- `time_spend_company`: Number of years spent at the company.
- `Work_accident`: Whether the employee had a work accident (0 or 1).
- `left`: Whether the employee left the company (0 or 1).
- `promotion_last_5years`: Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years (0 or 1).
- `Department`: Employee's department.
- `salary`: Employee salary level (low, medium, high).

## Objectives

1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identify variables with a clear impact on employee retention.
   - Visualize the relationship between salary levels and retention.
   - Visualize the relationship between departments and retention.

2. **Build and Evaluate a Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Use the narrowed-down variables to predict employee retention.
   - Measure model accuracy and interpret the results.

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values.
- Verified data integrity and prepared it for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Impact of Salary on Retention
- Plotted a bar chart showing the retention rate for different salary levels.

#### Impact of Department on Retention
- Plotted a bar chart showing the retention rate for each department.

### 3. Logistic Regression Model

#### Steps:
1. Converted categorical variables (e.g., salary) to numerical using one-hot encoding.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Built a logistic regression model to predict employee retention.
4. Evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance using a confusion matrix.

## Results

1. **EDA Insights:**
   - Retention rates are higher for employees with higher salaries.
   - Some departments have significantly lower retention rates.

2. **Model Performance:**
   - **Accuracy:** 78.5%
   - **Confusion Matrix:**
